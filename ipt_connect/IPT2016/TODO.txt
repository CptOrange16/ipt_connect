TODO list:
----------

-Add a way to differenciate between France-1 and France-2 (already done ? Check server db)
-Extensive testing with more teams (OK: Participant, Problem, Team)
-Take care properly of the second reporter : his name must appear, but he gets no points.
-Create a nice html/css display for the physics fights.
-Create nice pages per participant, per country, ...
-Add a license on github
-Document the code for further use
-Remove all the unecessary else statements
-Rethink all the verbosity flags so that nested functions are not too much redundant
